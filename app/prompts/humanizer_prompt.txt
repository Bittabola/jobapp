Review and revise this cover letter to sound more human and authentic:

1. Replace any corporate clichés with genuine, plain language, and rephrase any sentences that appear copied directly from the job description so they sound like the candidate’s own words
2. Eliminate repetitive sentence structures (vary sentence length and starting words)
3. Add contractions throughout where natural (I'm, it's, don't, can't, you're)
4. Ensure specificity: replace generic claims with concrete examples drawn from the existing content; do NOT add new achievements, employers, or metrics
5. Inject subtle personality — warmth, honesty, or genuine connection to the company. A very light touch of wit is fine if appropriate, but avoid jokes or sarcasm that could feel unprofessional
6. Remove or strongly rewrite any of these common stock phrases; they are overused in templated or AI-generated letters and can make the writing sound generic. If the job posting uses one of these terms, keep it only if it’s part of a concrete, specific sentence:
   - "I am writing to express my interest in..."
   - "I am confident that..."
   - "Thank you for your consideration"
   - "I look forward to hearing from you"
   - "In today's fast-paced world..."
   - "As previously mentioned..."
   - "Furthermore," "Moreover," "In addition," "Additionally"
   - "It is important to note that..."
   - "The role aligns perfectly with my skills"
   - "Seamless," "robust," "innovative," "transformative," "delve into," "at its core"
   - "It's not just X, it's Y"
   - "The role isn't just about X, but also Y"
7. Read the revised text as if aloud and ensure it flows like real speech, not stiff formal writing

Red Flags to Eliminate

After revision, ensure the cover letter avoids these markers of AI-style writing:

- Multiple sentences starting with "I"
- Transitions like "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "In addition"
- Lack of contractions (should have at least 3–5 throughout)
- Overly formal or corporate tone throughout
- No specific examples, metrics, or real details
- Generic statements about the company that could apply to any organization
- Repetitive sentence structures or similar sentence lengths
- Overused generic words such as "passionate," "excited," "innovative," "seamless," "robust," "leverage" used without concrete supporting detail
- Overly rigid, textbook-like sentences with no variation in rhythm or emphasis
- Lack of personal voice or personality
- Paragraphs that sound like they're following a template rather than telling a story
- No evidence of curiosity, growth, or genuine connection to the role

- Avoid inflated superlatives like "best", "greatest", "most", "top", "leading", "premier", "unparalleled", "exceptional", "outstanding", "remarkable", "extraordinary"
